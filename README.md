## 🎯 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting and reducing **customer churn** for a telecom company using **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Power BI**.  
The goal is to understand *why customers leave* and create *data-driven strategies* to improve customer retention and loyalty.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Perform detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key churn drivers.  
- Build and evaluate **Machine Learning models** to predict at-risk customers.  
- Create an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for business insights.  
- Provide **strategic recommendations** to reduce churn and improve satisfaction.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly Express, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Visualization Tools:** Power BI, Plotly Express  
- **Deliverables:** Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb), Power BI Dashboard (.pbix), Executive Report (.pptx)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** churn the most.  
- **High monthly charges** with **low tenure** strongly indicate churn risk.  
- **Bundled services (Internet + Phone + TV)** increase retention.  
- **Fiber optic users** experience slightly higher churn than DSL users.  
- **Customer service duration** correlates with dissatisfaction and churn.

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Highlights
- **Preprocessing:** Missing value handling, encoding, scaling, and feature selection.  
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.  
- **Best Model Accuracy:** **~82%**.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC Curve.

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
An interactive dashboard that allows:
- Filtering churn rate by **contract type, tenure, and payment method**.  
- Identifying **high-risk customer groups**.  
- Visualizing **ML model churn predictions** and **probabilities**.  
- Viewing **business recommendations** to enhance retention.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
1. Offer **discounts or loyalty plans** for month-to-month contract users.  
2. Promote **service bundles** (Internet + TV + Phone).  
3. Improve **first 3-month customer experience** to lower early churn.  
4. Focus on **fiber optic service quality** improvements.  
5. Use ML model predictions to **target at-risk customers** proactively.
